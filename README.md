### Final Project
For my project, I will analyze some basic COVID-19 data and produce a map.

To analyze the data, you will need to install some R packages. The required packages can be installed using `make install` in the terminal.

### Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run `make report` in the terminal.

This will create a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results.
