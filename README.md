## INFO 550

### Final Project
For my project, I will analyze some basic chimp genetic data and produce a histogram.

To access the analysis, after being labelled as a collaborator, you can run `docker pull dpthomas/info550dockerrepo:latest` to pull the image.

Within the image, mount the project directory to a local directory to retrieve the output. This output will be a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results.
